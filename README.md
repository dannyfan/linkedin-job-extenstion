# Linkedin Job Search Extender Chrome Extension

Linkedin's "Based on your profile" page shows list of jobs. But it isn't sorted by how recent the listing is. This chrome extension is used to solve that. Also hides any "try premium" ads and the messaging bar.

## Set up
1. Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dfan001/linkedin-job-extenstion.git
```
2. Turn on developer mode on chrome
* Go to `chrome://extensions` on Chrome.
* Toggle on the `Developer mode` switch.

3. Add the extension to chrome
* Click `LOAD UNPACK` and select the `linkedin-job-extension` directory.

4. Go to https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/
